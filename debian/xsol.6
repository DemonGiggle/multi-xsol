.SH NAME
xsol \- X Solitaire
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xsol
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page briefly documents
.BR xsol
, a simple Motif/ Lesstif version of the classic solitaire game.
It was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.
.br
.SH "HOW TO PLAY"
Solitaire is a card game. At the start you are presented with seven
columns of cards. First has only one card, second one has two, third
three and so on (28 in total), but only the first card in every
column is shown ('opened'). Also there is the deck (24 cards at the
start), and four emtpy places for suit stacks.
.sp
Cards in the deck and in the columns are unsorted, and the object of
Solitaire is to use all the cards in the deck to build up the four
suit stacks in ascending order, beginning with the aces. You can
accomplish that by dragging and dropping the red onto the black (and
black onto the red) cards between the columns, and between the deck
and the columns (but not the other way around). When you see a whole
turned card, click on it to see it ('open' it) and to be able to move
it somewhere. Deck is opened by clicking on it; once you reach the
end of the deck, just click once more and you'll reopen it.
.sp
If you reach a point when you can't move any more cards to the stacks,
and rearranging cards in columns and the deck gets you nowhere, the
game is over. Start it again.
